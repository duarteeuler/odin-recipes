            <h1>Pasta</h1>
            <p>Pasta is a type of Italian food made from durum wheat flour and water. It comes in many shapes and sizes, such as spaghetti, penne, fettuccine, and shells. Pasta is usually cooked by boiling it in water until it is tender, then it is drained and served with a sauce or other toppings. Pasta is a staple food in many countries and is enjoyed as a quick and easy meal. It can be paired with a wide variety of sauces, from simple tomato sauces to rich, creamy Alfredo sauces. Pasta is also a popular choice for entertaining, as it can be made in large quantities and is easily customizable to suit different tastes.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
                <li>Drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Add a drizzle of olive oil and toss to coat the pasta and prevent it from sticking together.</li>
                <li>In a separate pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and red pepper flakes and saut√© until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add diced tomatoes and tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes to the pan and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and ground black pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Add a handful of fresh basil leaves to the sauce and stir to combine. Remove the pan from the heat.</li>
                <li>Pour the sauce over the pasta and toss to coat the pasta evenly. Grate Parmesan cheese over the top of the pasta and serve immediately.</li>
