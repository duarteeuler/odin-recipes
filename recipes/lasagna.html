                <li>Cook the pasta sheets according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>

                <li>Coat the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish with a little bit of olive oil and butter.</li>
                <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a layer of the meat mixture on the bottom of the baking dish. Top with a layer of pasta sheets, followed by another layer of the meat mixture and a layer of shredded cheese. Repeat these layers until you have used up all of the ingredients, ending with a layer of cheese on top.</li>
